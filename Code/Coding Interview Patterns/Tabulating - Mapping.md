#### Problem Ex:
https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python/N0ZJEAjl2zK

### Ex Code, General form
#code-interview #tracking #contains-duplicate
```python
def contains_duplicate(nums):
    ''' Returns True if nums contains any duplicate
    '''
    # mapping num to count (or existence)
    nums_found = dict()
    for n in nums:
        # If dupe so far bail with True
        if isFound(n, nums_found):
            return True
        else:
            # else track it
            trackFound(n, nums_found)
    return False

```

#### EX: Two-Sum
Note: for unsorted.  If sorted use [[Sliding Window]] & Kadane's
#code-interview #two-sum 
```python
    '''
    Problem:  For the given array of integers arr and a target t, 
    you have to identify the two indices that add up to generate the target t.
    Moreover, you canâ€™t use the same index twice, and there will be only one solution.

    EX: [-4,-8,0,-7,-3,-10], -15 -> -8, -7

    Analysis
    - Sounds like "tracking" ...  what have we seen before?
    - What to track:  Diff with target, so when we see that value we know the 
        metching index
    '''
    visited = {}

    for i, current in enumerate(arr):
        diff = t - current
        # print(i, current, diff, visited)
        if diff in visited.keys():
            # print("Found", diff)
            return [visited[diff], i]
        visited[current] = i
    return []
 
```
