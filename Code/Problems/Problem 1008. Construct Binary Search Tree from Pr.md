Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.

It is guaranteed that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.

**Trick:  Need to use a stack (or callstack)**
