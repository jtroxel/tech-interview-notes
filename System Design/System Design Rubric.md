#### A “good” or "just ok" system design interview candidate:

-   Designs a complete system, but does not take hints from or interact with their interviewer
-   Interacts with their interviewer, but is unable to change direction when prompted to do so
-   Identifies metrics, but they aren’t clearly measurable or defined
-   Provides numerical estimates for key system component properties, but does not justify them
-   Finishes the design, but gets bogged down in unnecessary tangents or rabbit holes
-   Finishes the design, but rushes through the final details and does not leave time for questions
-   Understands the connection between most, but not all, core components of the design
-   Considers trade-offs and compromises after being prompted to do so
-   Neglects to assess the final design against its initial objectives
